				<p>Designer, yes. Developer, sort-of yes. Storyteller, tell me if you make it to the end.</p>
				<p>Design has been my way to help express interesting ideas. But I also graduated from it.</p>
				<p>I've helped <a href="http://www.calcanet.com/">Calcanet</a> sell domains, others to sell cars, dog food, human food, downloadable mobile pictures (back in the WAP era), horse racing news and tips, and one of my favorites <a href="https://godarkchocolate.com/">GoDark Chocolate</a>, a premium chocolate brand.</p>
				<p>
					Built some cool stuff for OpenEnglish for student testing and payments, a tele-medicine app for the Miami Children's Hospital, airline tickets bookings, and lately a telecom billing platform at <a href="https://quotingbill.com">QuotingBill</a> that you should check out.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm continuously learning new ways to bring ideas to life (corny, I know) and have experience with different methodologies and technologies, Shape up (from the <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">ShapeUp</a> book) has been my best experience so far in delivering relevant products that matter.
				</p>
				<p>I ask a lot, write notes and love teaming up with devs, business and everyone I can to get the best results.</p>
				<p>
					I'm a musician so in my spare time I bang some tunes to enjoy life.<br>
					Enough for of me now. I'm curious about you, so shoot me a message so we can start talking.
