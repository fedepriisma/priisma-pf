				THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") constitutes a legally binding agreement between Priisma, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the state of Florida ("Priisma"), and the user, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("User"), with regard to access and use of Priisma's website: https://www.priisma.com (the "Website") and any other media form, channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked or otherwise connected thereto. By accessing or using the Website, the User agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the User does not agree to these terms and conditions, they should not access or use the Website.
			</p>

			<h2 class="my-4 font-bold text-md">1. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>

Unless otherwise indicated, the Website and all content, including source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics of any nature and regardless of format (herein, collectively or individually, the "Content"), and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained there (the "Marks"), are owned and controlled by Priisma and are protected by copyright and trademark laws and any other applicable intellectual property law or regulation of the United States, foreign jurisdictions, and international conventions. The Content and Marks are provided "as is" for the User's information and personal use only. Except as expressly provided herein, no part of the Website and no Content may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without Priisma's express prior written permission. Priisma reserves all rights in the Website, Content, and Marks.

<h2 class="my-4 font-bold text-md">2. Ownership of Materials</h2>

All design and original source files created on the User's behalf ("Projects") belong to the User, and the User shall be the sole owner of the copyright for all Projects. In the event that any operation of law would cause Priisma to become the owner of a Project, in whole or in part, rather than the User, Priisma irrevocably and perpetually assigns its entire interest in the Project to the User, without limitation. The User warrants that any and all materials provided to Priisma as examples or as material to be incorporated into a project during the design process are owned by the User and do not infringe on or misappropriate any third party's rights, including, but not limited to, all intellectual property rights and any right of publicity. Priisma always reserves the right to share the User's design work publicly (social media, website, etc.) unless agreed upon in writing by both parties.

<h2 class="my-4 font-bold text-md">3. Third-Party Fonts</h2>

In the event that any Project incorporates fonts that are not owned by Priisma and require a commercial license in order for the User to legally reproduce, distribute, or publicly display the Project ("Third-Party Font(s)"), Priisma will inform the User in writing that one or more Third-Party Fonts have been incorporated into the Project and that the User will need to purchase one or more licenses for the Third-Party Fonts from the rights-holder(s) of said Third-Party Fonts in order to legally reproduce, distribute, or publicly display the Project. Said notice will include information sufficient for the User to identify which licenses are required and who to contact in order to purchase said licenses. So long as Priisma has informed the User of the incorporation of Third-Party Fonts as described above, the User assumes all responsibility for any consequences as a result of a failure by the User to purchase one or more licenses for any Third-Party Fonts incorporated into a Project.
